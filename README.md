# Calendar
a javascript calendar object

The goal of this project is to make the most dynamic javascript calendar object, open-source and free to use!

Prereqs:

JQuery

Requirements to contribute:

Adhere to the end purpose of this project - making the most dynamic, configurable, and available calendar javascript object.
Nothing else!

Roadmap / To-Do Items:

Add an option to iterate through predefined year and month lists (and abstract year and month lists from the current JS Date() functionality).
Add an option to dynamically iterate through years and months as defined by JS Date().
Completely distinguish the JS Date() functionality from the core Calendar functionality - users should be able to feed custom values into all fields of the calendar.
Add "widgets" or "plugins" that can exist on/in the calendar application based on the dates that they consume.
Add time to calendar days for more accurate displays of daily information.
Add localization support.
Better implement and allow for configurable styling.
